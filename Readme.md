## Caveat &ndash; RevitLookup Cannot Snoop Everything

This clarification was prompted by
the [issue #35 &ndash; RevitLookup doesn't snoop all members](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/issues/35):

**Question:** I tried snooping a selected Structural Rebar element in the active view and found not all of the Rebar class members showed up in the Snoop Objects window. One of many members that weren't there: `Rebar.GetFullGeometryForView` method.

Is this the expected behaviour? I was thinking I could get all object members just with  RevitLookup and without the Revit API help file `RevitAPI.chm`.

**Answer:** RevitLookup cannot report **all** properties and methods on **all** elements.

For instance, in the case of `GetFullGeometryForView`, a view input argument is required.
How is RevitLookup supposed to be able to guess what view you are interested in?

For methods requiring dynamic input that cannot be automatically determined, you can [make use of more intimate interactive database exploration tools, e.g. RevitPythonShell](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html).
