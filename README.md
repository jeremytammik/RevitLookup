## <a name="builds"></a> Builds

[Build Informed GmbH](https://www.buildinformed.com) very kindly set up a
public [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) for RevitLookup
at [lookupbuilds.com](https://lookupbuilds.com)
using [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com).
The output is dual-signed with the Build Informed certificate, zipped and published to an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Installation

You install RevitLookup just like any other Revit add-in,
by [copying the add-in manifest and the assembly DLL to the Revit Add-Ins folder](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Add_In_Integration_Add_in_Registration_html).

<!----
by [copying the add-in manifest and the assembly DLL to the Revit Add-Ins folder](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-4FFDB03E-6936-417C-9772-8FC258A261F7).

If you specify the full DLL pathname in the add-in manifest, it can also be located elsewhere.

For more information on installing Revit add-ins in general, please refer to
the [Revit API getting started material](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).

Harry Mattison of [Boost your BIM](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) very kindly provides
a ready-built [RevitLookup 2018 installer](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2017/04/28/revit-lookup-2018-install):

> If you don’t want to deal with source code and just want to use the tool, here
is [Revit Lookup 2018.msi](https://drive.google.com/open?id=182W00Mk5Hj1FMHAo-xVnoFYlJ_s2Swrw),
an installer for the compiled and signed DLL ready, courtesy of Boost Your BIM.

Harry's installer was cleaned up
by [@VBScab](https://github.com/VBScab) and submitted to this repository
in [issue #51 &ndash; the MSI in the project is flawed](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/issues/51).
Here is the [cleaned-up RevitLookup 2018.0.0.0 installer](installer/revit_lookup_2018.0.0.0.msi).
However, please note that other, more recent builds exist for Revit 2018.
As explained above, they can be downloaded sans installer
from [lookupbuilds.com](https://lookupbuilds.com).

Harry shared a new installer in his post
on [RevitLookup for Revit 2020](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/revit-lookup-for-revit-2020),
which I also added to the [installer folder](installer)
in  [RevitLookup2017-2020.msi](installer/RevitLookup2017-2020.msi).
Says he:

> I’ve added some conditional compilation and multiple configurations so that the single solution can be used to build against any version of Revit 2017-2020.

<a name="caveat"></a>
## Caveat &ndash; RevitLookup Cannot Snoop Everything

This clarification was prompted by
the [issue #35 &ndash; RevitLookup doesn't snoop all members](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/issues/35):

**Question:** I tried snooping a selected Structural Rebar element in the active view and found not all of the Rebar class members showed up in the Snoop Objects window. One of many members that weren't there: `Rebar.GetFullGeometryForView` method.

Is this the expected behaviour? I was thinking I could get all object members just with  RevitLookup and without the Revit API help file `RevitAPI.chm`.

**Answer:** RevitLookup cannot report **all** properties and methods on **all** elements.

For instance, in the case of GetFullGeometryForView, a view input argument is required. How is RevitLookup supposed to be able to guess what view you are interested in?

For methods requiring dynamic input that cannot be automatically determined, you will have to [make use of more intimate interactive database exploration tools, e.g. RevitPythonShell](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html).
