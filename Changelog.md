To celebrate it, we are excited to introduce a major new feature in this release that will transform your interaction with models, offering a deeper understanding of the geometric
objects that constitute your models.

## Introducing Geometry Visualization

This release includes comprehensive Geometry Visualization capabilities, enabling users to visualize various geometry objects directly within the RevitLookup interface.

In Revit, geometry is at the core of every model.
Whether you are dealing with simple shapes or intricate structures, having the ability to visualize geometric elements can significantly improve your workflow, analysis and
understanding of the BIM.

To illustrate the power of these visualization capabilities, here's a glimpse of the geometric objects you can now explore directly within RevitLookup:

| Geometry    | Illustration                                                                                                     |
